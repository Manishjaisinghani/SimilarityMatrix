# SimilarityMatrix

Generate similarity matrices

**precondition:**
- should be executed in python3
- first two columns(article title and word count in article) and first row(words) in data.csv should be removed.

**Execution:**
- python3 Similarity.py

**PostResult**
Three separate files have been generated by name:
- cosdist.csv — This represents cosine similarity matrix
- jacdist.csv — This represents jacard similarity matrix
- eudist.csv — This represents euclidean similarity matrix


**Visualization:**

- We are using seaborn in python to represent graphs.
- the graph is a heat map to represent similarity matrix.
- The python script name is Visualization.py
- The same should be executed in python3 and the distance matrix should be changed every time to get new graph.
